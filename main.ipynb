    "This dataset includes all **Major Crime Indicators (MCI)** occurrences by reported date and related offences from 2014 to June 30, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Major Crime Indicators categories include Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery and Theft Over (Excludes Sexual Violations). \n",
    "\n",
    "This data is provided at the offence and/or victim level, therefore one occurrence number may have several rows of data associated to the various MCIs used to categorize the occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data does not include occurrences that have been deemed unfounded. The definition of unfounded according to Statistics Canada is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted” (Statistics Canada, 2020).**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is intended to provide communities with information regarding public safety and awareness. The data supplied to the Toronto Police Service by the reporting parties is preliminary and may not have been fully verified at the time of publishing the dataset.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The location of crime occurrences have been deliberately offset to the nearest road intersection node to protect the privacy of parties involved in the occurrence. All location data must be considered as an approximate location of the occurrence and users are advised not to interpret any of these locations as related to a specific address or individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Due to the offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division and Neighbourhood may not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within these geographies. Therefore, the Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other source of crime data.\n",

    "By accessing these datasets, the user agrees to full acknowledgement of the Open Government Licence - Ontario.\n",

    "In accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data.\n",
